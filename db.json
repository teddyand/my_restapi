The solutions range from trying a variety of different `tsconfig.json` configurations and even adding `\"type\": \"module\"` to your `package.json` file (which would stop Next.js and any other setup from working entirely).\n\n## Running a Typescript script with TSX\n\nI managed to find [`tsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx) after a lot of useless Googling and testing Stackoverflow answers that simply didn't help. All I had to do was replace my script in my `package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"cache\": \"ts-node lib/file.ts\"\n```\n\nWith TSX:\n\n```json\n\"cache\": \"tsx lib/file.ts\"\n```\n\nAnd that was it! No weird errors, no need to configure a separate `tsconfig.json` file. Just plug and play!\n\n\u003CNotice\u003E\n\nI'm 99% sure everything that `tsx` can do can be done in `ts-node`or similar Typescript runners (with the right config and setup). However the big upside of `tsx` is how no-config it is.\n\nIt's really as easy as install and run!\n\n\u003C/Notice\u003E\n\n## Running a Typescript ESM script with TSX\n\nOne footnote: in certain cases your script might need to import a package that has been converted to ES modules. Unless that package also supports CommonJS it's likely you'll be met with an error like this:\n\n```js\n❯ yarn run cache\n\nError [ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED]: No \\\"exports\\\" main defined in \u003Cpath to your package here\u003E\n```\n\nIn these cases all you have to do is to change your file name from `file.ts` to `file.mts` and then change your command to:\n\n```json\n\"cache\": \"tsx lib/file.mts\"\n```\n\nThis will tell `tsx` to run the entire file as an ES module, solving your error!\n\n",
